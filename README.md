# Recipe_app

# Project description: Recipe CRUD
A CRUD application allows a user to create, read, update or delete selected data. For this project, I built the interface of a food recipe CRUD app. 

The interface won't use a database or an API to store the data; it will require you to use React's useState() hook.
